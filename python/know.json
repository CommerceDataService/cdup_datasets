With sunlight eliminated, combustion sources are readily detected, particularly in the M10 band. The recorded signal can be fully attributed to the combustion source. In our analysis we use data from all of the VIIRS bands collecting data at night. The M10 band data are used to detect combustion sources. To eliminate noise, confirmation is sought in the Day/Night Band (DNB), M7, M8 and M12. Plank curve fitting is performed to estimate the temperature of background and heat source. Results are distributed in form of CSV files and KMZ files. The KMZ has data from the local maxima detected in the M10 band. Filtering is used to eliminate the bow tie effects from the identification of local maxima. The CSV has data from all of the pixels with radiances above background noise in the M10 band. Atmospheric correction is performed with MODTRAN parameterized with temperature and moisture profiles processed from the simultaneously acquired CrIS and ATMS sensors. Readme file is also available in case of situations out of BAU. Note that the processing algorithms have been evolving over time. Once the processing algorithms are stabilized we will reprocess the 2012 archive. ",
